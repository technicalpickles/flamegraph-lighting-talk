## Hi

Josh Nichols

aka technicalpickles

I work at Gusto

I'm easily nerdsniped by performance issues

## An example program

Let's look at a program (simple.rbl

What does this do? `hello` is called, which calls `world`, whicih calls `itsa`

```
‚ùØ ruby simple.rb
main
hello
world
itsa me pickles
sup
yall
```

## Profiling

Imagine we already have a tool to profile and visualize.. it might look like:

```
[-------- main ----------------------------------------------]
[--------------hello---][-------- sup ----------][-- yall--]
      [-----------world]
           [-------itsa]
```

## Caller

There's a handy ruby method `caller`

Shows the stack trace of the program at the time it's called

Let's add that to our log message:

```
‚ùØ ruby simple.rb                                                              ‚îÄ‚ïØ
main
simple.rb:35:in `<main>'

hello
simple.rb:37:in `<main>'
simple.rb:8:in `hello'

world
simple.rb:37:in `<main>'
simple.rb:10:in `hello'
simple.rb:14:in `world'

itsa me pickles
simple.rb:37:in `<main>'
simple.rb:10:in `hello'
simple.rb:16:in `world'
simple.rb:20:in `itsa'

sup
simple.rb:38:in `<main>'
simple.rb:25:in `sup'

yall
simple.rb:39:in `<main>'
simple.rb:30:in `yall'
```

What if we lined them up horizontally?

[simple.txt](simple.txt)

That is getting pretty close to the visualize.

Now imagine constantly capturing these stack traces, and automatically grouping them like we just did

## Flamegraph

Now let's try looking at a real flamegraph.

I've built a gem called [singed](https://github.com/rubyatscale/singed). Built on these excellent tools:

It wraps profiling your code with stackprof or rbspy, and then launching speedscope to view it.

- [stackprof](https://github.com/tmm1/stackprof)
- [rbspy](https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy)
- [speedscope](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope)

## Running it

Let's run it:

```
‚ùØ bin/singed ruby simple.rb
üî•üìà Singed needs to run as root, but will drop permissions back to your user. Prompting with sudo now...
Password:
$ sudo --preserve-env rbspy record --format speedscope --file /var/folders/92/0kw80yh95bz8b431qwjvmctm0000gn/T/speedscope-cli-20230426102911.json --silent -- ruby simple.rb

```

Looks pretty close

## Aside

Flames burn up, right? Not down?

Yeah, I don't know when we switched from them going up to down

Theory: has to do with making it easy


## Interpretting this

If you are looking at a line, then the line above it called it

When looking at a 'frame':
- was called by the 'frame' above
- calls the frame below it
- for each point when there isn't a frame directly below it, time is spent in that method 

We are using `sleep` so it's pretty clear time is _only_ in that frame


## Rails

## Complexity

During Eileen's keynote, she said something to the effect of:

Rails focuses on making develoepr experience simple, and does that by taking on complexity


Guess what we are now seeing :D 

We have to do a lot of scrolling to find our application code. This is pretty common, unfortunately.
